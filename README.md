# Hablink

Hablink is an application that allows users to create and share habits with friends. A user may create a habit, adjust its details, and share it with friends of their choice. Users may also compete with friends to instill the habit in their daily routine.

# Technologies

Hablink was created using React Native as a front-end framework; it was styled using TailwindCSS. We utilized firebase as a back-end to store user data as well as handle authentication.
